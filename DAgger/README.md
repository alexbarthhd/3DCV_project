## Important clarifications on the structure and usage of the custom donkeycar application

This is a modification of a donkeycar application created using the command

```
donkeycar create --path /path/to/mycar
```

Executing the command shown below starts dagger. Execution must be stopped manually by the user. The learned model named 'dagger.pt' can be found in the models folder and executed in the ML app. It is recommended to empty the data folder before starting dagger.

## usage

Execute the following command in a donkey environment (see donkeycar documentation for instructions)

```
python manage.py drive
```
